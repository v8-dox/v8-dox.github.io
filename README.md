v8-dox
======

I generated the Doxygen dox for all the versions of
[node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) and
[io.js](https://github.com/iojs/io.js), then
pushed them back up GitHub pages.

To update the dox, run `update.sh`.

I would suggest using [nan](https://github.com/rvagg/nan) and not writing add-on code that directly calls v8.

These dox are made possible because of Grokker, one of the best places to work. If you are a JS developer looking for a new gig, send me an email at &#x5b;'chad', String.fromCharCode(64), 'grokker', String.fromCharCode(0x2e), 'com'&#x5d;.join('').
